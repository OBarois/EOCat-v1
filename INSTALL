Set-up on macos (tested on v10.11+)

1- Install node :
https://nodejs.org/dist/v7.0.0/node-v7.0.0.pkg

2- install homebrew package manager:
/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"

3- install mongodb:
brew install mongodb

3- install utility to generate keys
sudo npm install -g pwgen

4- change dir to the root directory of EOCat (where this README file is located)

5- install all node module dependencies required by EOCat (this creates a dir ./node_modules)
npm install


6- generate server keys and certificates (needed if using https) - This creates a ./ssl directory or replace the existing one
TBC: skip this step. It could be that the key and certificates included in the package are good enough...
./utilities/generate_ssl_keycert.sh

7- start/stop the Catalogue server (this also spawn the mongodb process) - will listen to both http and https:
  To start it: ./eocat -s
      - If it does not already exist, this will create the dir ./data/mongodb where the database will be stored
      - Once started, it opens the address https://localhost:3443/*/search?format=eocat&count=200&startIndex=1 in your default browser -> should be a json indicating the number of items found.
  To stop it:  ./eocat -e
  To check status: ./eocat -c


To populate catalogue  (see example scripts in ./test) - run from the ./test/ dir
curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -vX POST --data @testProduct.json http://localhost:3000/products/

Search example:
curl  'http://localhost:3000/L_S1_SAR_IW/search?start=2015-12-24T00:00:00Z&stop=2015-12-26T23:59:59Z&bbox=-1.238689741328246,37.72928979042203,23.635026167534672,46.82259459559691&status=ARCHIVED&operationalMode=IW&ngEO_DO={processing:GRD,resolution:HR}&format=json&count=200&startIndex=1'

Get a product by its id:
curl  'http://localhost:3000/products/S1A_IW_RAW__0SDV_20151224T042858_20151224T042930_009179_00D377'
